## Introduction

This project is coming from a [codecademy project](https://www.codecademy.com/).

The purpose of this project is to form beginners coders to write their own small program on their own environment. Personally, i used Visual Studio Code and JavaScript.

## Programs

There are two scripts.js : 
+ jokesGenerator.js which generate a random joke everytime you run the program.
+ ASCIIgenerator.js which generate a random (small) [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) art everytime you run the program.
